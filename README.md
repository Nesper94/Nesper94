I like to learn and teach. I am now promoting the development of Computational
Biology in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, you can visit our [group web page](https://biologia-computacional.github.io/)
if you are interested.

I'm passionate about science and knowledge. Althought trained as biologist,
my interests go from Physics and Mathematics to Software Engineering, and
I wish I had more time to explore these fields in all their depth.
